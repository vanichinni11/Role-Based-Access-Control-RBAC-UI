# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI Documentation**

## **Overview**

The **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** UI provides a secure and user-friendly interface for managing users, roles, and permissions within an application. Administrators can define roles, assign permissions to those roles, and manage users by assigning them specific roles. The RBAC model ensures that users have the appropriate level of access to resources based on their roles.

### **Core Components**
1. **Users** - Individuals who are assigned roles and have permissions associated with those roles.
2. **Roles** - Groups of permissions that can be assigned to users. Roles control the level of access a user has.
3. **Permissions** - Rights or actions that can be performed within the application (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).

### **Features of the RBAC UI**
- **User Management**: Add, edit, and delete users. Assign roles to users.
- **Role Management**: Define new roles, assign permissions to roles, and edit roles.
- **Permission Management**: Dynamically assign and modify permissions for roles.
- **CRUD Operations**: Simulate server-side operations to add/edit users, roles, and permissions (using mock API calls).
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Assign different roles to users (Admin, User, etc.) with different levels of access.

---

## **System Requirements**
- **ReactJS** for building the front-end interface.
- **State Management** with React's `useState` for managing users, roles, and permissions.
- **Routing** with `react-router-dom` for navigating between different views (Users, Roles, Permissions).

---

## **Features and Functionality**

### **1. User Management**

#### **Features:**
- View a list of users along with their assigned roles and current status (Active/Inactive).
- Add a new user and assign them a role (Admin, User, etc.).
- Edit an existing userâ€™s details and role assignment.
- Delete a user.
  
#### **Key Actions:**
- **Add User**: Allows the admin to enter user details (name, role, status) and add the user to the system.
- **Edit User**: Modify the existing details of a user.
- **Delete User**: Remove the user from the system.
  
#### **File**: `UserList.js`

---

### **2. Role Management**

#### **Features:**
- Define new roles (Admin, User, etc.).
- Edit existing roles and manage their permissions.
- Delete roles that are no longer required.
  
#### **Key Actions:**
- **Add Role**: Create a new role with a specific set of permissions.
- **Edit Role**: Modify the permissions associated with an existing role.
- **Delete Role**: Remove roles from the system.

#### **File**: `RoleList.js`

---

### **3. Permissions Management**

#### **Features:**
- Dynamically assign permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to roles.
- Modify permissions for existing roles through checkboxes.
  
#### **Key Actions:**
- **Assign Permissions**: Admins can select permissions (Read, Write, Delete) for each role.
- **Edit Permissions**: Modify the permissions for existing roles by toggling checkboxes.
- **Delete Permissions**: Remove specific permissions from roles if needed.

#### **File**: `Permissions.js`

---

## **How RBAC is Implemented**

### **1. Role-Based Access**
- Roles such as **Admin** and **User** are predefined and can be assigned to users.
- The **Admin** role has full permissions (Read, Write, Delete), while the **User** role is limited to only **Read** permission.
  
### **2. Dynamic Permissions**
- **Permissions** (Read, Write, Delete) are dynamically assigned to roles. These permissions define what actions a user can perform within the system.
- Admins can toggle these permissions using checkboxes in the UI for each role.

### **3. User-Role Assignment**
- When a new user is added, the admin can assign a role (Admin or User).
- The permissions associated with the assigned role are automatically inherited by the user.

### **4. CRUD Operations**
- All changes related to users, roles, and permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are managed through mock API functions (`fetchData`, `saveData`).

## **File Structure Overview**

```
/src
|-- /components
|   |-- Modal.js            # Modal form for adding/editing roles and users
|   |-- Permissions.js      # Handles permissions management
|   |-- RoleList.js         # Displays and manages roles
|   |-- UserList.js         # Displays and manages users
|-- /api
|   |-- data.js             # Simulated API functions for CRUD operations
|-- App.js                  # Main entry point of the application
|-- index.js                # ReactDOM render
```

## **Installation**

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui.git
```

### **Step 2: Install dependencies**
Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
cd rbac-ui
npm install
```

### **Step 3: Run the application**
```bash
npm start
```
The application will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

## **How to Use the RBAC UI**

1. **Login as Admin (for testing purposes):**
   - The application simulates an admin role where all users can be managed.
   
2. **Navigate to the User Management Page:**
   - You can see a list of users along with their assigned roles and statuses.
   - Add, edit, or delete users by interacting with the buttons next to each user.

3. **Navigate to the Role Management Page:**
   - Here, you can manage roles and their associated permissions (Read, Write, Delete).
   - Add new roles, edit permissions, or delete roles as needed.

4. **Navigate to the Permissions Management Page:**
   - Admins can toggle permissions for each role (Admin, User, etc.).

---

## **Code Explanation**

### **UserList.js**
- Displays the list of users.
- Admins can assign or edit roles for users.
- Calls mock API functions to simulate CRUD operations for users.

### **RoleList.js**
- Displays the list of roles.
- Admins can create new roles and assign permissions to them.
- Roles and permissions are managed using checkboxes.

### **Permissions.js**
- Displays the permissions that can be toggled for each role.
- Permissions can be dynamically assigned or modified.

### **Modal.js**
- A modal form is used for adding/editing users and roles.
- Fields include name, role, and permissions.

### **App.js**
- Sets up routing and navigation between different pages (Users, Roles, Permissions).

## **API Simulation**

The API functions are located in the `data.js` file and include:

- **fetchData()**: Returns mock data for users and roles.
- **saveData(data)**: Simulates saving user and role data.

---

## **Security Considerations**
- This is a basic simulation of RBAC. In a real-world application, additional security measures should be implemented:
  - **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure only authorized users can access the admin interface.
  - **Backend Integration**: Use a backend service (e.g., Node.js, Django) to persist user data and permissions securely.

---

## **Conclusion**

This **RBAC UI** project provides a simple, yet effective, way to manage users, roles, and permissions based on the **Role-Based Access Control** model. It allows administrators to define roles, assign permissions to those roles, and manage users based on their roles within the system. The project is designed to be easily extended, offering a flexible foundation for more complex systems that require user access control.
